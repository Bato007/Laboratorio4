    <string name="biography">
        I was born in 11/12/2000 on Guatemala, by my mother Silvia and my father Roberto.
        \nI started school at the age of 5 in "Lluvias del Saber" that closed that year,
        so I moved to "Marubal" for one year until I went to MacDermont School were I
        finished my school days.
        \nSo I decided to study Computer Science because I like technology and I like to
        innovate so it was the perfect career, the FJBG grant me a scholarship for UVG, I
        liked my first year a lot. I hope that I do the same with this year.
